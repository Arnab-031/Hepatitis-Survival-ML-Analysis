# Hepatitis-Survival-ML-Analysis
This project predicts survival outcomes in hepatitis patients using machine learning. Scikit-Learn is used to evaluate classifiers like Random Forest and Decision Trees, apply hyperparameter tuning, and explore stacking ensembles. Results reveal key features, analyze performance, and provide insights to enhance accuracy and model robustness.
